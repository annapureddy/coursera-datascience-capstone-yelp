Finding the right business, for you!
========================================================
- Problem: 
    - Given category and city, find best businesses for a user
    - Example: Find the best restaurant for a user in a city
- Naive approach
    - Recommend popular choices
    - Cons: Does not take user preferences into account
- Can we do better?

How can we do better?
========================================================
- Take user ratings into consideration
    - Rating is a single number, can combine several signals
    - We only use star ratings in our analysis
- Several algorithms 
    - User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF)
        - Leverage users similar to a given user
        - Generate list of "similar" users (50 in our case)
        - Business ranked using rating of similar users 
    - Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF)
    - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- UBCF performs the best!

How does UBCF work?
========================================================
- Leverage users similar to a given user
    - Similarity is measured using choice of ratings
- A list of "similar" users for each user is generated
    - Top 'nn' similar users chosen (nn = 50 in our case)
    - (or) All users in a certain threshold are considered
- For a given business:
    - Ratings of similar users are weighted by similarity
    - This weighted average is used as rating of given user
- The businesses are then ranked by these ratings
    - Considered top 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 recommendations 
    
Evaluation
========================================================
- Evaluation setup considerations (due to data size)
    - Restaurants category only
    - First 10 cities only
    - Users who gave at least 20 ratings
    - 4-fold cross validation done for all algorithms
- UBCF performs the best predictions!

Conclusions and future work
========================================================
- Predicting best businesses for users is feasible 
    - We can do better than naive popular algorithm
- UBCF algorithm performs the best amongst all considered
- Future work
    - Improve cold start recommendations (20 ratings required now)
    - Use more signals than just star ratings 
    - Use zipcode and radius, rather than city 
    - Blend different algorithms for best predictions
